// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening.
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// we are assigning name to Dane
// if name is equal to Mary, log to the console "say Hi"
//else log to the console "How do you do?"
//

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
//we are declaring sectet but are not assigning any value
//we are declaring secret and assiging 123 to it
//the if statement: if code is equal to 123, assign 123 to the secret variable, also code is equal to code * 2
//the if statement part 2: if code is greater 250 , assign secret to "duper"
//finally, we are log secret to console

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// we declare isStudent and set it to true
//declare age and set it to 34
//declare zip and set it 55407
// if the variable isStudent is equal to true and zip is greater tahn 8000,
//log to console "You're a student aon the west coast!";
//else if the isStudent is equal to false  or age is less than 30,
//log "Welcome to prime " to console;
//else log "How about the weather?" to console

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code.
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2.
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment.
// Should be number++.
number--;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'


//Issue: colorOne is set to purple but colorTwo has not been reassigned to purple
//Fix - set colorOne =colorTwo = "purple"
/*
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'


// Issue: And keys word, the code is or which will make the if statement true
// fix - We need to change || to &&

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

//issue: <=. It should be >= and
// to fix: We need to change the condition to >= and we need to change no entery to enter and set the else to log no entery

/*
let age = 21;
const minAge = 21;

if(minAge <= age) {
